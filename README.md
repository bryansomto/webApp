A scientific calculator still in development. Basic features unavailable includes;

1. Delete button.
2. Radian value of sine, cosine and tangent.
3. Degree value of inverse of; sine, cosine and tangent. 
4. Evaluation without operators (e.g 5cos2).

Kindly point out other bugs if found (there's definitely a whole colonyðŸ˜…).
I'd totally welcome help adding the above lacking features and new features.
